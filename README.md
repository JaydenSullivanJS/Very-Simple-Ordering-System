This is my first public GitHub project for people who would like to learn C and would like to get a deeper understanding of it.

To use this project, you would need to download an IDE that supports C a free IDE for this is CLion. Here is the link (https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/)

When you have downloaded the program, download my GitHub project and open it within the IDE of your choice, and review the comments to get a deeper understanding.

If you have any issues at all, please contact me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-sullivan-9733b236a/ 


[ If you use this program to learn you don't have to credit me but a star and a linkedIn connection would mean a lot! ]
