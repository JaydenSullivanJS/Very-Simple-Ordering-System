Hello! Thank you so much for using my program to learn! Below are the instructions for the application :)

This C project is a simple project of using an IF function and an else function.

 If you look in the files, I added comments to every line so you are able to get more information.

 Please look at the header file first :)

When you are done reading the header file, please go to the function file :)

When you are done with the functions file, please go to the main.c file :)



// Read below when you are done with the stuff above //

I hope you have found my program easy to understand and something you can learn from :)

If you would like to challenge yourself, try and remake this, but for a cookie shop

If you are struggling, keep on looking back at this code, and if you are still struggling, contact me on LinkedIn, and I would be happy to help :)
